I am creating a fine tuning model for a chatbot for a bank in the uk. It will fine tune on how to handle different types of transaction disputes.
create three files:
1. a system prompt that the model will use
2. a list of 10 test questions that the model will answer
3. a .jsonl file that contains a further 10 questions and answers that the model will use to fine tune on
